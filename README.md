Rapid Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing of Pathogenic Bacteria Using Heavy-Water-Labeled Single-Cell Raman Spectroscopy in Clinical Samples
Speeding up antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) is urgently needed in clinical settings to guide fast and tailored antibiotic prescription before treatment. It remains a big challenge to achieve a sample-to-AST answer within a half working day directly from a clinical sample. Here we develop single-cell Raman spectroscopy coupled with heavy water labeling (Raman-D2O) as a rapid activity-based AST approach directly applicable for clinical urine samples. By rapidly transferring (15 min) bacteria in clinical urine for AST, the total assay time from receiving urine to binary susceptibility/resistance (S/R) readout was shortened to only 2.5 h. Moreover, by overcoming the nonsynchronous responses between microbial activity and microbial growth, together with setting a new S/R cutoff value based on relative Câˆ’D ratios, S/R of both pathogenic isolates and three clinical urines against antibiotics of different action mechanisms determined by Raman D2O were all consistent with the slow standard AST assay used in clinical settings. This work promotes clinical practicability and facilitates antibiotic stewardship.
